=== 0.1.0 / 2011-04-12

* Happy birthday!
* All standard RTSP methods supported.
* Captures RTP data to a file, but doesn't ensure RTP sequencing before putting to file.
* One client object can only handle 1 stream; use a client per stream until this functionality
  gets implemented.
* Only handles unicast, UDP streams.
* RTSP exceptions are all +RTSP::Error+s; this will change.
